# NOTE TO THE READER

You are reading a **DRAFT VERSION** of the Ascension whitepaper.

While the design of Ascension is fairly complete, several sections of this whitepaper remain unfinished. Furthermore, any details are subject to change without notice.

# Intro

In this whitepaper we present the design of **Ascension**, the first decentralized exchange dedicated to *algorithmically-priced markets* (**APMs**), also known as *token-bonded curve assets* (TBCs) and *liquid tokens*. In contrast to earlier designs of bonded curves, Ascension's APMs support *leverage*. The leverage is applied algorithmically in accordance with market conditions, and reversed on market downturns. Algorithmic leverage introduces the potential of far greater profits for all token-investors, while maintaining the *non-security token* properties of many other TBC-style investments that are currently being designed.

Ascension combines social and crypto-economic features to make it easy for non-technical users to enter the crypto-sphere, and begin investing in tradeable crypto-assets. The combination of a decentrally governed exchange with the social features of discussion and news should create a self-governing community of blockchain users who - together - can forge the future of the next great crypto-financial market segment: the **crypto-capital** markets.

#### Market Overview

The recent success of the experimentation with scarcity-based investments such as crypto-kitties, which provide no dividend flows to investors and are valued solely based on their predictable future scarcity, has revealed the potential for an entirely new kind of value-generation and trading.

**Algorithmically priced markets** are smart-contract based tokens that can be traded immediately without requiring a counter-party. Tokens are purchased from the smart contract, and can be sold back to the smart contract at a later time. The contract sets the price in accordance with transparent mathematical rules (based on AI-technology) which try to guarantee a fair and representative price at every turn. 

In the past, the value of investments based solely on scarcity has often been hard to predict. The value of a cryptokitty may disappear at any point with the interest in the cryptokitties game. On the contrary, Ascension focuses on the trading of "virtual assets" which are always monadically tied to a real-world underlying phenomenon. This makes the appropriate price of the scarce token rationally predictable, based solely on the properties of the underlying.

Want to invest in that *new movie* you're hyped about and are sure will be a big success? Or maybe that *photographer* you think is great, but who isn't anywhere near as popular yet as they should be? Maybe you're *local sports team*? Or the *politician* you think will become the next governor of California? The possibilities for stable long-term investments based on real-world data are near endless, and the resulting tokens can be traded efficiently by inexperienced traders with niche interests, who are essentially domain experts.

Ascension is the place where everyone will have a chance to *use their own special insights into the world* in order to participate and profit in a newly rising global value-creating movement, centered on the trading of virtual assets representing important valuable real-world phenomena.

<a id="market-potential"></a>

#### Market Potential

One in four millenials has expressed an interest in investing in crypto-currencies. However the process is still technically challenging and obscure. Valuing startups is an important part of capital markets, however it is not everyone's cup of tea.

Any person however who is a domain expert in a given field will soon be able to rationally and (with enough care) successfully trade in virtual assets that are based on those real-world phenomena that they are most familar with. Their knowledge will enable them to rationally predict the future outlook of the markets, allowing the algorithmically derived price to acquire the same signalling value provided by traditional financial markets.
 
Virtual assets require that **the underlying represents real value to society** in order to enable rational trading behavior on a large scale. Because virtual assets are *tied* to the success of their underlying phenomena, traders can predict that markets based on these phenomena will be **meta-stable** (i.e. stable for long periods of time), and value created in these markets will not disappear with unpredictable shifts of interest - (who can predict how long crypto-kitties will remain of interest to traders?).

Because the trading behavior is rational, and based on predictable real-world phenomena (like career trajectories) the market price movements are broadly predictable over the long-term. This allows us to infer that the stability of the entire system of virtual markets itself is also predictable. For details on this, see the section "[The Meta-Stability of Real and Virtual Economies](#the-meta-stability-of-real-and-virtual-economies)".

<a id="future-outlook"></a>

#### Future Outlook

In the coming years everything under the sun will become tradeable inside the ever expanding crypto-sphere, and these investments will be available to everyone - not just the more technically minded early adopters, or the rich and accredited investor. People from all over the world will trade scarce assets in the crypto-capital markets that are based on phenomena that are important *to them*. Because these phenomena are often aesthetic, people will naturally have the inclination and take the time to carefully study their future prospects.

We are facing a new golden era for finance, in which people are once more empowered to take control of their own money. The crypto-capital markets are open to all, and may one day become the largest segment of the entire crypto-financial ecosystem. We stand at the very beginning of that process, and we believe that all early investors in this new market segment will stand to profit enormously as it may become the "popular face" of crypto-currency.
 
Many different projects are working towards realizing this vision on a limited scale (see Appendix A-C).

Ascension presents the first **universal** marketplace for user-created virtual crypto-assets. Only the traders' imagination, and the need for a shared perception of the real economic value of the underlying, limits what can and cannot be traded.

<a id="scarcity"></a>

#### Scarcity

In order to avoid the splintering of the markets, which would limit the scarcity value of all semantically based tokens, thereby undermining and threatening the potential of this great new decentralized value-generating movement, we propose the formation of a co-operating network of market-places, called the **Semantic Token Interchange Compact**. Any token traded on any exchange that joins the STIC can be moved to and traded on all other participating exchanges - guaranteeing the *uniqueness and scarcity* of all such virtual assets within the entire network of exchanges.

For details on this, see the section "[Scarcity of Virtual Assets and the STIC](#scarcity-of-virtual-assets-and-the-stic)".

Because of the economic network effects this creates for both investors and exchanges, the STIC (or a future analogue) will likely achieve a beneficial monopoly within the crypto-capital market segment. It requires a minimum of safety standards of all participating exchanges, be they centralized or decentralized, and guarantees investors the ability to move their tokens from one exchange to another at any point.

Ascension represents the first (and decentralized) exchange on the open STIC network.

It's going to be lots of fun for users - and the public testnet starts very soon (January 2019).

# Overview

<a id="crypto-capital-markets"></a>

## Crypto-Capital Markets

The traditional capital markets, comprising stocks and derivatives, are by far the largest markets in the world.

These asset classes comprise a host of different financial instruments, based either directly or (more likely) indirectly on various underlying phenomena (such as companies) that provide economic value to society.

The value of the capital markets to the economy at large, is that they provide much needed funding for both new and existing commercial ventures. They also create value which diffuses throughout the economy through various direct and indirect means.

However the value generation in the financial markets is far larger than the total value of the underlying assets (such as companies) that are traded - even if one extended that value into the future.

| Asset Group    | Total Estimated Value |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Currency       | $28.6 trillion        |
| National Debt  | $59.7 trillion        |
| Stocks         | $70 trillion          |
| Total Debt     | $199 trillion         |
| Derivatives    | $630 - $1200 trillion |

The economic value of the underlying assets is leveraged to high multiples, allowing e.g. a company's stock to trade at 10x its book value.

Cryptocurrencies have achieved great success in a very short time. They represent the greatest paradigm-changing development in finance in this generation. Yet while the size of the crypto-markets has multipled by **7.5x between 2013 and 2016**, and again by **18x between 2016 and 2018**, they still account for only a fraction of globally traded value.

| Asset Group    | Total Estimated Value |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Cryptocurrency | $200 billion         |

Given that the volume of activity and interest from investors, including traditional financial institutions, grows by the day, this trend is likely to continue, and we will see another 10x growth spurt within the next 2 years.

Bitcoin was initially conceived with the aim of taking on all the functions of traditional currencies, and eventually challenging the dollar as the incumbent global reserve currency.

But over the last years we have seen a wide range of experimentation in the field of crypto-finance, with many promising results that show that crypto-markets can take on most of the important functions of traditional capital markets, such as

1. providing funding to innovative but risky commercial ventures
2. crowd-sourcing market signals from investors to optimize company performance

The great benefit of crypto-finance is that it is accessible to anyone, anywhere, at any time. Because crypto-assets do not usually carry or bestow any traditional legal obligations, they operate in a legal grey-zone.

While some jurisdictions have taken measures to limit the freedom of the crypto-currency markets, most jurisdictions have taken a laid back approach to regulation. In the current laissez-faire climate therefore an amazing opportunity exists for financial experimentation that has not been seen on this planet in over a hundred years.

One of the most prominent experiments conducted last year was the surge in non-fungible tokens, starting with crypto-kitties. These tokens do not represent any underlying value in the traditional sense, and instead derive all value from their uniqueness and scarcity.

The success of Cryptokitties has highlighted the fact that scarcity alone, along with an efficient market, can suffice to generate real financial value - value that is unlikely to disappear again in the immediate future. However, the more stable the underlying phenomena the more stable the created value will be, and therefore underlying phenomena that are stable for years and decades will provide the safest virtual investments.

Recently, crypto-financial research has produced another candidate experiment: the *token-based curve* (hf. TBC). This pattern (also called 'liquid tokens'), on which the popular Bancor blockchain is based, relies on the insight that token prices do not *always* need to be agreed upon in advance through supply and demand - as long as we can **algorithmically infer** a reasonable price at every point.

This insight enables instant **liquidity in otherwise sparsely traded markets**, far increasing the total number of possible crypto-assets that can rationally be traded with the expectation of realizing a profit for investors at a future time.

In this whitepaper we explore the potential of the token-based curve pattern in the pursuit of expanding the currently still miniscule **crypto-capital market segment** to the size that it *should have* (if we accept that the same potential that is found in traditional finance is also found in crypto-finance).

In the optimistic view, given the relative size of the stocks and derivatives markets as compared to cash holdings, we can estimate that the scale of the crypto-capital markets may one day dwarf that of more conservative, currency-oriented blockchains, *at an approximate ratio of 25:1*. We are talking about the potential value-generation of trillions and trillions of dollar-equivalents - value which will not disappear again overnight, but will become an integral part of the crypto-financial ecosystem.

Bitcoin's original vision of becoming the next reserve currency of the world is *completely compatible and synergistic* with the vision we will lay out below, in which everything becomes tradeable, and enormous amounts of value will be created. The markets have shown that the time is now ripe to explore *new areas of crypto-finance*, including derivative, and fractional reserve blockchains, and to blaze a new trail into the unknown.

We believe the growth of the crypto-*capital* markets will be decentralized, and driven by many different market actors, tokens and blockchains. We also believe that **Ascension**, and the **Semantic Token Interchange Compact (STIC)** which we present below, represent a significant step forward in that process. We hope Ascension can serve to lay a foundation on top of which many others will build, and that it will greatly benefit people from all over the world who have a forward-thinking outlook on the prospects of the entire crypto-financial ecosystem.

## A Vision of the Future

**2020** *Tom is a Go programmer, and while browsing through Github he finds a 
        great new library. It has only 44 stars, but if the benchmarks are to be believed, it is a game changer. After trying it out for himself, he
        opens an Ascension portal app on his phone and searches for the library by name. Nothing found.*

*Because the Ascension search results would have told him so otherwise, he knows that no token token has been issued yet for this software project in any of the major crypto-capital markets.*

*A few taps later he has created a new APM token tied to the Github repository URL of the library. He knows that if the library author finds out about the token and wants to connect with the market, he can authenticate himself with the Ascension blockchain (or any other STIC member blockchain).*

*Creating the token costs Tom about 200 quarks (about 20 cents). It receives the globally unique token number STIC-T18127-V1:M201. He knows that the value of this token will always depend mostly on the success of the Github project.*

*As one of its first big fans, Tom buys 1000 tokens at the standard issue price.*

**2021** *About a year later, the project has taken off in a big way. Thousands of programmers use it at daily at companies all over the world. Both programmers and traders alike are tracking the success of the project via the automatically procured data feeds that the Ascension portal curates.*

*Tom's tokens have grown in value by 12.3x in the meantime, and given the excellent long-term prospects of the project over the next years, his profits are secure.*

**2023** *Two years later, with the growth of the project slowing down, Tom divests half of his holdings -- he has found a new great project that he believes will make it big.*

## A New Organization <a href="#table-of-contents">↑</a>

Decentralized blockchain projects present an alluring vision of a future in which people from all over the world can equally and without undue hindrance realize their full potential in the open global economy.

However in working towards this ideal of a decentralized future, not enough attention has been paid to the pragmatic limits on the efficiency of different organizational structures inside the very competetive landscapes of business and finance.

For this reason, over the last years we have seen a number of regrettable failures play out, from projects which implode because of organizational inefficiency (such as The DAO), to the many projects which have so far regressed to the status quo that they only outwardly mimic the decentralized templates of organization, while in reality their organizational structure is strongly centralized - driven by greed and a silent disbelief in the power of the decentralized model these projects present us with a kind of Animal Farm situation, in which the pigs have again learnt to walk

Ascension aims to be among the third-generation of decentralized blockchain projects which break this cycle, and definitely and permanently commit the future of the blockchain to a decentralized governance system.

At the same time, the design of Ascension (called the Open Company Model) aims to strongly increase the ability of a blockchain ecosystem to **aggressively scale**. This means combining decentralized decision making procedures with a business-like focus on the **need for speed** when competing in the global economy against large multi-national players.

The policy of Ascension is driven through the new mechanism of Goal-Directed Markets, which are goal-focussed markets that track multiple teams competing to fulfill a common roadmap. The markets incentivize the timely fulfillment of milestones, and allow stake-holders to directly guide and influence the prospects of the blockchain growth - while leaving the work up to the most able teams and contractors from all over the world.

# Algorithmically Priced Markets: The Journey from TBCs

    TODO: rewrite this section, expand

A token-bonded curve (TBC) is a new crypto-economic design pattern which has been gaining traction lately; see e.g.

- [Token Bonding Curves in Practice (P. Kohlhaas, 08/18)
](https://tokeneconomy.co/token-bonding-curves-in-practice-3eb904720cb8)
- [Token Bonding Curves Explained
 (J. Goro, 04/18)](https://medium.com/@justingoro/token-bonding-curves-explained-7a9332198e0e).

In short, a *token-bonded curve* is a smart contract which serves as a market maker for a continously minted token. The mint process is tied to the buying of tokens, such that new tokens are issued whenever more tokens are purchased from the contract. On the flipside, token holders can also sell their tokens back to the contract, potentially realizing a profit.

This pattern enables the creation of crypto-assets with instant liquidity, independent of the number of market participants. The price of the asset at any given time is determined algorithmically.

Initial research into TBCs has produced a price model based on the formula

> reserveRatio = poolBalance / (currentPrice * tokenSupply)
>
> -- [How to Make Bonding Curves for Continuous Token Models (S. Balasanov, 02/18)](https://blog.relevant.community/how-to-make-bonding-curves-for-continuous-token-models-3784653f8b17)

also called the "Bancor" formula.

This formula (which can be re-arranged to yield the current price) drives a price curve *upwards*, driven by a simplified form of market demand. Specifically, if more and more people purchase tokens, the price increases, and when people sell, the price decreases again.

How quickly the price increases or decreases is driven by the reserveRatio, which is a constant fractional number between 0 and 1. One can use this formula to create price curves that have different shapes, some rising very quickly, others more slowly.

The purchase price and the sale price of a token may differ at any given point in time, in such a way that the sale price "lags behind" the purchase price. In this (increasingly popular) design variation, one often speaks of two curves: the *buy curve* and the *sell curve*.

Other research has suggested the possible utility of more complex, rule-based formulas. See e.g. [On Single Bonding Curves for Continuous Token Models (W. Lau, 07/18)](https://medium.com/thoughtchains/on-single-bonding-curves-for-continuous-token-models-a167f5ffef89)

However all prior research has focused on curve formulas that are driven by a mostly static, pre-defined curve shape. While this approach has some apparent benefits, specifically in the ease of implementation, and the ability of the curve-designer to select from a large number of possible shapes, it also has drawbacks:

Markets driven by static curves are not likely to actually realize the "intended" shape of the price curve in practice. As most of the extant research does not take market behavior (traders buying AND selling) into account properly.

The projections made for purchase and sell behavior seem to be based *not* on any model of common trading behavior, but on a model of crowdfunding behavior, in which most people simply "pay into the pot", and few if any ever cash out.

This can lead to inflated expectations of market growth, and requires the curve designer to be supernaturally prescient in anticipating the life-time behavior of the market in order to avoid misaligning investor expectations. 

This is a difficult task, and very hard to get right. Even the "Bancor" blockchain token itself did not succeed in realizing the explosive growth promised by Bancor's customly-parameterized version of their eponymous *price curve formula*.

While it is projected by some researchers that TBC tokens will become tradeable on secondary exchanges, allowing for the (full or fractional) reserve of the token contract to be complemented by the new money coming in through these side-channels, it is unlikely that this suffices to make the model a very profitable investment structure for either traders or issuers, unless in fact *most* of the trading moves to the secondary exchanges.

The reason for this is that the price of the tokens on the secondary exchanges must always be below the sell price set algorithmically by the TBC contract, and can therefore not easily escape the constraint that the (full or fractional) buy-back reserve of the contract imposes: in order for people to cash out, the price must be depressed, which can exhaust the reserve making it impossible to cash out until someone else pays in again.

<a id="the-market-potential-of-tbcs"></a>

## The Market Potential of TBCs

TBCs open up another gateway for crypto-currencies to enter the mass market.

Any person, group or company can easily issue a TBC, and assuming others buy into the market, the value of the tokens will increase over time, just as if the token had immediately been listed on an exchange.

This value increase can be used to fund both commerical and non-commercial projects, on whose successes the future value of the tokens will depend. **Rational investors will choose to sell out of tokens that are tied to failing projects, and re-invest their funds into tokens tied to tomorrows' rising stars.**

TBCs therefore have a continuous signalling function, which is what explains their incredible potential for large-scale value-creation in the same vein as has been observed in the traditional stock markets.

Because of the ease with which smart-contract based token markets can be created, a wealth of new tokens will be issued by people who lack the technical know-how to create their own crypto-currency, but are very knowledgable in their own respective domains - be they the future of the housing market, or the 

It has thus been conjectured that TBCs can allow most anything to become tradeable, including but not limited to IP, open-source projects (e.g. github repos), memes, celebrities, sports teams, and political issues.

There are many active teams working on realizing a limited domain-specific vision for the trading of TBC-based assets. See e.g.

<a id="from-token-bonded-curves-to-algorithmically-priced-markets"></a>

## From Token-Bonded Curves to Algorithmically-Priced Markets

To enable the trading of stable TBC markets, one requires a sufficiently capable algorithmic price model, that enables users to purchase tokens directly from the smart contract, rather than indirectly from other token holders.

Several different approaches have been proposed, such as sigmoid curves (see [3](https://medium.com/thoughtchains/on-single-bonding-curves-for-continuous-token-models-a167f5ffef89)). These techniques have different benefits and tradeoffs. **Ascension introduces the concept of algorithmically priced markets** (hf. APMs), in which the price model of the TBC is not driven by a fixed curve formula, but by a more complex *machine-learning based* model, which takes into account the current market trends and conditions.

Specifically, APMs try to **mirror the behavior of prices on the stock markets**, in order to provide a more traditionally efficient price discovery mechanism - thereby ensuring a greater signalling value of the price that is realized by the market.
            
APMs enable the price of the token to better represent the future value of the underlying, creating the same potential for *leveraged value-generation* observed in the financial markets. Because the price is rational, the leverage achieved over the nominal investment flowing into the market is justified by the predictable future development of the price flows of the market itself. In other words, traders predict not only the future of the underlying, but also the future of the market itself.
    
Traditional TBCs do not support leveraged value-generation in the same vein, which limits the potential gains that users can expect from such investments. This is sometimes touted as a benefit (see e.g. [2]), because it makes investments more predictable and less risky - something which, at least on the surface, presents a positive contrast to the traditional financial markets.

However, there is *no free lunch* [5](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/free-lunch.asp) -- and by de-risking TBC investments, the ability to generate value in the markets is greatly deflated.

This not only makes them less interesting to short-term investors, but also to long term token holders. It discourages both small-time and large-scale institutional investors, and is almost certainly the *wrong paradigm* - a misguided and impractical idea to restrict the freedom of the markets in order to protect investors from making bad decisions.

*Instead we propose that the markets should be allowed to operate freely,
and that the effect of the algorithmic price model on the price discovery should be minimized, such that the algorithmically-priced markets can function in a way that is as closely analogous to the traditional capital markets as is possible.*

In an APM, the price moves in accordance with **recent** investor behavior, allowing the market to more quickly respond to new negative information about the underlying. This means that value can both be generated on the way up, as well as lost on the way down, **depending primarily only on the the performance of the underlying**.

If the performance of the underlying decreases slowly, more value can be extracted in a sustained downturn. However, if the underlying suddenly fails in an unexpected way, the price of the markets will quickly mirror the new rational outlook on its future performance.

Through this capability, an APM has substantially greater signalling value than a traditional TBC, and thereby will support the same rationally-driven leveraged value generation that has been observed in the stock markets.

<a id="2-reparameterizable-curves"></a>

### 2. Reparameterizable Curves

All traditional (static) TBCs are *reparameterizable* given a sufficiently broad consensus of the market parcitipants. Through Ascension's easy-to-use governance model, users can choose to alter the algorithmic parameters of (static) curves they are invested in, to adapt to changing macro-economic trends.

Even the entire model used can be switched out at any point, if a sufficiently large consensus of stake is found. This is important, because otherwise the investment may be doomed by an initially bad choice of the curve model.

# Crypto-Finance: The New Era of Finance

An important distinction when thinking about the future of finance is that between *positive economics* (what works in practice) and *normative economics* (how we'd like things to work). The markets have shown that the "imperfectly rational investor" described by behavior economics is esentially *good enough* in order to enable markets, overall, to create massive amounts of value - as long as they remain efficient and are allowed to operate freely.

Throwing out the incredibly beneficial value-generating potential of financial markets right alongside the idea of the *perfectly* rational investor would be like throwing the proverbial baby out with the bathwater!

How many technological innovations would we have missed out on, or would we still be waiting for, if the capital markets did not exist to finance startups and entrepreneurship?

Ascension's commitment to algorithmically-priced markets which support leveraged value-generation seeks to follow the great success example that was charted by the traditional financial markets. Algorithmically priced markets point one way towards a future in which crypto-assets are traded widely and requently all over the world by young and old - for both fun and profit.

The far less restricted regulations pertaining to crypto-investments *today* have opened up a new possible golden age of finance, in which all can be equally enabled to participate in this communal value-generating activity.

Once more the barriers that have been set up and maintained by the prevailing socio-economic stratification are weakened, and today it is possible to **rise up from near poverty to substantial riches** with little more than dedication, *smarts*, and access to the blockchains.

Ascension is another step towards guaranteeing that these barriers will not harden again. 

The design of Ascension is explicitly based on a model of the stability of crypto-assets that does not rely on positing *any future dividend flows, or any liquidation value*.

We do not assume that crypto-assets cannot *pay* dividends, but we are saying that **they do not need to**. The scarcity value of the token, combined with the signalling value of the market, together suffice to guarantee the possibility of stable and growing token value over time.

The model of valuing tokens we present below - called the meta-stability model - is *simple and general* enough to account for the value in not only all common crypto-currency investments (including TBCs), but also all regular stocks, other common financial instruments, and national currencies.

<a id="the-meta-stability-model"></a>

# The Meta-Stability Model

We define *an economic system to be "meta-stable" iff it consistently absorbs temporary instabilities and partial crashes while maintaining a positive growth rate*, as measured in terms of the **volume of capital throughput** (throughput = inflows - outflows).

This is a dynamic model of a dynamic process. It focuses on the stability criterion of this dynamic process, **independent of how this stability is achieved in practice**. If the dynamic process is a company, it will depend on the commercial performance of the company. If the dynamic process is a musician, that performance will be based on the measurable commercial or popular success of their music. If the dynamic process is an environmental issue, the performance will depend on the measurable success of all actors working towards addressing said issue. Etc.

The underlying process is not made *irrelevant*, but on the contrary it becomes **the only relevant thing, period**. The market behavior is considered as *monadically tied* to the behavior of the dynamic process on top of which it is based. The stability of the underlying process, and its continued value to society together **completely determine the meta-stability of the financial asset**.

<a id="the-meta-stability-of-individual-markets"></a>

## The Meta-Stability of Individual Markets

The price movement in any efficient market depends primarily on the observed performance of the underlying. As news becomes available that allow the traders to re-assess the future prospects of the underlying, the market price will shift either up or down.

It works the exact same way in a market in which the underlying does not represent a trading entity, such as a company.

But how is this possible? Is not the value of a stock, for example, derived from the commercial activity of the underlying company?

When we look closely at stocks, in light of what we have seen in the crypto-currency markets, and instead of shutting our eyes against the possibility that economic theory can advance further in the 21st century than it has in the 20th, we can notice some interesting pecularities with this perspective.

If the value of the stock *did* depend directly - via value flows, i.e. money changing hands through dividends or stock buy-backs - on the commercial activity of the underlying, and not only it's *performance*, we would expect the majority of the value creation in the stock market to be directly correlatable to current and future *value flows* from the company to investors.

This however is often **not** the case in practice:

|       Stock      | Dividend Yield | Capital Gains Yield (09/2017-09/2018) |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Apple (AAPL)     |     1.4%       | 39.2% |
| Amazon (AMZN)    | no dividend    | 99.5% |
| Alphabet (GOOG)  | no dividend    | 25.6% |
| Microsoft (MSFT) | 1.5%           | 45.9% |
| Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) | no dividend | 20.8% |
| Facebook (FB)    | no dividend    | -5%   |

These are the 6 largest companies (by market cap) in the S&P 500. Though they are not to be taken as representative of all stocks, they show part of the normal range of meta-stable stock markets, and how little the *direct exchange of value* (in terms of hard cash from the underlying company back to the investors) matters to the value creation that takes place in the financial markets, through the mechanism of *psychological credit*.

Even if we added the liquidation value of each of these companies on top of their total dividend yield, we would not get to more than a fraction of the total value generated *and extracted* from these stock markets over their lifetime.

In the meta-stability model this investment pattern makes perfect sense: **The value of the stock does not derive primarily from the value flows between the underlying and the investors.** It relies almost exclusively on the market's assessment of the underlying, and the performance of the underlying over time.
The "commercial" activity of an underlying, it would appear then, matters only if it happens to *be* a commercial enterprise.

If it is not a commercial enterprise, trading is based on other empircal metrics that indicate *growth* and success, or *decline* and imminent failure. The behavior of the markets is equally predictable, and all profit vs risk trade-offs continue to apply, independent of the commercial nature of the underlying.

What is different about a non-commercial ("virtual") underlying is that it does not promise *any* direct value flows (i.e. dividends, liquidation value) back to the investors. But because these value flows **do not account** for any significant amount of the value generated by the financial markets, we do not need to care about this aspect.

It suffices that we can predict that the **real value** assigned to the underlying by all current market participants will continue to exist in the future, and will continue to be recognized by society.

We can cut out the dividend yield *and* the liquidation value of the underlying, and the remainder will *still* be tradeable (and will be able to generate the same proportional amounts of profit) **if** the market agrees that future market participants will *rationally value* the underlying equally or even more than current market participants do today.

These future traders **will do so if and only if they in turn believe the same about those who will follow after them**. When is this the case? If and only if the underlying virtual asset represents a long-running process which continuously (or at intervals) generates real value in the eyes of society.

It does not depend on any specific commercial activity, nor the profits generated from such an activity.

To sum up: **Markets predict the future of markets, indirectly via the future of the underlying.** The actual transfer of value from the underlying to the market is **irrelevant** to the majority of value created by the market. Traders are paid by future traders, and this is perfectly rational as long as we know that the market will remain stable over a long time period. 

Whatever value is lost in the end will be absorbed by the future market participants *at that point*, but because those rational traders will have spread their investments, the entire crypto-economy (made up of all the crypto-financial markets) will continue to prosper, and each individual market participant can write off the partial losses from the failure of individual markets.

If we accept this, then we can see that **virtual assets**, which have 
*no dividend flow*, can be traded successfully over arbitrarily long periods of time, given only that:

1. the asset is scarce and will remain scarce
2. the underlying has real value to society, thereby enabling rational traders to predict price movements by how much they believe future traders will value the underlying

Because the price is still driven by the *performance* of the underlying - if it is a company, that will be its commercial performance. But the commercial activity itself does not in fact need to *cover* any significant amount of the value generation in the correlated markets. That money never flows back into the markets, anyway.

(Look at the above table of stocks again, if you feel unsure about the importance of dividends. Value generation in the markets does not stop, and dividend flows never catch up with the market.)

Why then is there such a strong connection between the market cap and the scale of the commercial activity? Simple: the valuation of the market assesses each asset's future value relative to the future value of other *similar assets*. Therefore a commercial enterprise will be valued relative to other commercial enterprises, based on its predictable future commercial success (or lack thereof).

This however does not imply that non-commercial asset classes cannot be traded, nor does it indicate exactly how valuable these asset classes would be. Society in general does not only value commercial companies. It values all sorts of things, especially those which carry a positive emotional association, including: celebrities, movies, sports teams, tourist attractions, environmental issues, scientific advances, positive political developments, and even memes and *crypto-kitties*.

As a result, in the meta-stable model of financial markets **all kinds of *virtual* assets can be seen to be rationally tradeable**, given only that a reasonable prediction can be made about the rational valuation of the underlying by tomorrow's traders, and about the future scarcity of the virtual assets.

Similarily, the intrinsic value of gold is irrelevant. Gold can act as a store of value not because it is heavy, or has various niche applications in some modern industries. It can do so because today's traders can rationally predict that tomorrow's traders will value gold as much (or more) than they do today.

## Understanding Meta-Stability

Meta-stability is both relative and absolute. It is relative, because the growth rate of the capital throughput can differ widely between different economic systems, and it is absolute, because there is a threshold after which a meta-stable economic system becomes *unstable*, and crashes.

Meta-stablity is therefore on a spectrum. On one end of the spectrum we have the best investments possible, with the highest yields; on the other end of the spectrum we're basically throwing our money into a dumpster fire.

![Meta-Stable and Unstable Curves](https://getascension.com/img/metastable_and_unstable_curve_patterns.png)

There is a threshold in the middle of the spectrum that demarcates the *good* investments from the *bad* investments. Bad investments will crash and burn before we can realize any profit, but good investments will stay stable *long enough* for the value appreciation to cover the outlay and a substantial profit margin.

As long as the economy as a whole continues to grow and expand, the tendency of rational investors to **spread their funds over multiple investments** that are likely to remain stable long enough for the total value appreciation to produce a profit, allows the investors to absorb the losses from any *unexpectedly unstable* curves, that might occur because of unforseen events or imperfect predictions of the future outlook of the underlying.

From the perspective of meta-stability, different investments can be classified by their capital throughput curve.

A ponzi scheme is one type of investment that has a crashing capital throughput curve.

![Ponzi Scheme](https://getascension.com/img/ponzi_scheme_unstable_curve_pattern.png)

In contrast, an investment scheme like social security, which is designed to be meta-stable for generations, has a different, expanded (though potentially also crashing) capital throughput curve.

![Social Security](https://getascension.com/img/social_security_metastable_curve_pattern.png)

Similar to a Ponzi scheme, but without the fraudulent intent, a failing business venture may present a similarily unstable capital throughput curve.

![Failing Business](https://getascension.com/img/failing_venture_unstable_curve_pattern.png)

On the contrary a successful business venture will have a highly stable and growing capital throughput curve.

![Successful Business](https://getascension.com/img/successful_venture_metastable_curve_pattern.png)

And this same pattern can be observed with crypto-currency ventures that have no residual crash value.

### The Meta-Stability of Financial Markets

While meta-stability can be maintained over arbitrarily long time periods,
meta-stable processes eventually crash. Because the markets are based on the underlying performance of real world processes, the markets will also crash.

These events destroy value, and lose money for investors who are still holding long positions in the market at the time of the crash.

Does a crash always have to be quick? No, it can be a long and drawn-out process of slow degradation. However, while the latter gives individual investors more time to pull out, a lot of value will still be destroyed on the way down.

This is good.

Only this cycle of value creation and value destruction enables the financial markets to thrive in the way they do. It is the potential of value to be destroyed wholly and utterly *when things go wrong* that allows so much value to be created *when they go right*.

The financial markets therefore tend (via the combined self-interest of their investors) to optimize the underlying processes (such as companies) in order to increase their performance - through various direct and indirect means.

When we consider the value flows in the financial markets in isolation from the value flows of the underlying assets, we can delineate three basic scenarios:

1. The financial markets contain many crashing investments, which destroy value, and as a result, the entire financial economy crashes.
2. The financial markets contain *some* crashing investments, which destroy value, and as a result, the entire financial economy is slowly destroyed.
3. The financial markets contain *some* crashing investments, which destroy value, but the amount of value destroyed is significantly less than the amount of new value created in the same time-frame. **The result is that the financial system as a whole continues to grow**.

Does this leave individual investors to lose their money on crashing investments? Again, we can distinguish some basic scenarios:

* A. An investor pools all their money in a single investment, which crashes, and they lose their entire stake.
* B. An investor spreads their money over several investments, *some of which* crash, and they lose part of their stake. The result is that they lose money overall.
* C. An investor spreads their money over several investments, *some of which* crash, and they lose part of their stake. However their other investments increase in value, balancing out their losses. **The result is that they profit overall**.

Based on these two sets of scenarios we can derive some simple equations that explain the potential for value generation in a meta-stable financial system.

        TODO: add system and investor equations showing the range of meta-stable investments given various assumptions on market volume, growth, creation-rate, exchange-rate fluctuations, etc.

<a id="the-meta-stability-of-real-and-virtual-economies"></a>

## The Meta-Stability of Real and Virtual Economies

The purpose of an economy is to *efficiently route capital and products* between producers and consumers. The most traditional method through which this occurs is *direct trade* between consumers and producers. The value flows from consumers, via various intermediaries, to the producer - enabling future production of goods and services, as well as innovation.

![Trade (direct value flow)](https://getascension.com/img/trade_direct_value_flows.png)

But there is another mechanism which is equally fundamental to the workings of modern economies, and that is *psychological credit*.

Through the value-generating trick of

>   **market-cap = price * units-outstanding**

where *price is controlled by psychological valuation*, the financial markets enable *imperfectly rational investors* to assign *psychological credit* (the epistemic attitude of "this group of traders believes that this asset is worth *so-and-so* much money") to assets. Because the price moves in accordance with the cognitive attitudes of the traders, but the number of units outstanding remains mostly constant, any increase in price can disproportionately increase the "market value" of an asset - thereby leveraging the value of the asset through simple belief.

The ability to essentially **"mint" money through belief** is here possible **if and only if the traders are sufficiently rational**, such that other traders can trust their assessment of the underlying, and by implication, trust that the excess value created through the leverage effect is sufficiently stable so as not to disappear again in a market crash any time soon. If the market value is stable enough, it itself (e.g. in the form of tokens or stock certificates) can in turn be *offered* as collateral for loans, or recorded as profit on balance sheets.

As long as the chain of epistemic attitudes of belief is unbroken throughout the entire economy - **something only possible as long as everyone can believe that traders are valuing the underlying _rationally_** - the financial capital in circulation within an economy can increase significantly.

<a id="instability-vs-meta-stability"></a>

#### Instability vs Meta-Stability

The only limit imposed on the value-generating ability of this system is through the potentially cascading effects of margin calls through the chain of credit and collateral, cause by excessively optimistic predictions made by large groups of traders which are suddenly called into question. The re-evaluation of the underlying assets which were previously overvalued can lead to both smaller and larger crashes in financial systems.

However, instead of fearing this possibility, it is reasonable to face such potential instabilities head on, and treat them as a **design constraint** for fractional-reserve-based crypto-financial systems such as *Ascension*. It is this consideration which leads us to the notion of **"meta-stability"**: i.e. stability of the entire system in the face of occasional over-valuations.

To address this issue, the design of Ascension proscribes a very simple limit on the kind of virtual asset than can be traded: it must represent an actually existing underlying process which can be *rationally* valued.

Together with the blockchain-guaranteed efficiency of the token markets, which support both long and short positions on any given token, it is rational to predict that the values assigned to different tokens will be rational, and therefore the individual token-markets will be meta-stable.

Because the external value of the entire Ascension ecosystem depends primarily on the sum of the *meta-stable* value generated within the system, as long as it can be guaranteed that the individual token-markets are meta-stable, the value of Ascension as a whole will also be meta-stable, and should be equal to or in excess of the total value of all the CUBIT-denominated token markets.


<a id="the-growth-potential-of-ascension-and-the-crypto-capital-markets"></a>

## The Growth Potential of Ascension and the Crypto-Capital Markets

If we followed the currently proposed models of token-bonded curves, which sacrifice the value-generating capability of the financial markets in favor of a reduction in investment risk, we would also significantly hamper the future potential size of the nascent crypto-financial markets focussing on user-generated crypto-assets.

Instead we propose that efficient decentralized and **algorithmic financial policy** can maintain a stable and growing crypto-economy within the larger crypto-economic sphere, as long as

1. each token investor is strongly incentivized to invest rationally within the internal markets
2. the total growth of the currency reserve is limited by the decentralized consensus financial policy,
    and proportional to the user-growth rate, the capital-throughput and the general economic outlook;
3. smart and capable senators are *elected by the community* to continously adjust the parameters of the financial policy for the next quarter year.
4. the algorithmic price model that underlies the trading behavior of the token-bonded curves is sufficiently advanced, and regularly maintained to ensure its proper functioning
    
It is up the community of users to realize this vision by electing smart and capable *senators* who will implement a prudent and effective financial policy at every turn, to keep growing Ascension as fast as possible, without jeopardizing its financial health and future.

<a id="scarcity-of-virtual-assets-and-the-stic"></a>

# Scarcity of Virtual Assets and the STIC

Even though almost anything can be traded in tomorrow's crypto-markets, not all tokens and not all marketplaces will be created equal. The scarcity of a token depends to a significant degree on the absence of competing issuers of tokens which are (equivalently) tied to the same underlying.

The most naive prediction therefore would be that the largest market-places, being able to enforce a unique semantic mapping between underlying and token, such that for any given person for example only one unique token can be traded in the market-place which is monadically tied to that particular persons life and success. In other words, a single market-place can mandate that there is only one "Elon Musk" token or one "Yosemite Park" token.

Through the resolute enforcement of this **virtual scarcity mandate** a market-place can internally avoid a splintering of the markets, which would hurt investors.

However, this naive picture is not the likely, nor the most optimal future. What would occur is that soon new market-places would arise, which offer competing but semantically-equivalent tokens for purchase, thereby splintering the markets, and severely limiting not only the total size of each individual virtual asset market, but also the total growth potential of the entire crypto-capital ecosystem.

By these considerations we are led to propose the formation of the STIC, the **Semantic Token Interchange Compact**.

The STIC forms a network of co-operating crypto-capital market-places, which together enforce a **single unified virtual scarcity mandate**. Any virtual token tied, in a similar way, to a specific real underlying, is **movable** from one market-place to another at close-to-zero cost to the token-holder.

This enables all the virtual markets that trade the "Elon Musk" token to function as a single unified market place. Because the market is not splintered anymore, it can grow to its fullest potential size - and the same now applies to the entire crypto-capital ecosystem.

An interesting effect of the STIC proposal is the incentive structure it creates for individual market-places, both existing and to be founded in the future. If a new market-place decided to *abstain* from joining the STIC, or to *defect* from the STIC, all of its internal virtual asset markets would thereby become disconnected from the larger crypto-capital ecosystem.

This would represent a significant total loss of liquidity and value-extraction potential for all token-holders in all its internal markets - thereby strongly disincetivizing any rational market-place owner from defecting, or refusing to join the STIC.

In other words, we predict that **a single unified crypto-capital economy will arise that is based on a semantic token interchange guarantee**, and that all new market-places will (for better or worse) be strongly incentivized to join, unless they want their investors to be cut off from the rest of the markets, limiting the size of all their internal markets, and thereby their own growth potential as a market place.

Because such a network does not yet exist, we hereby propose its immediate formation.

The STIC has many beneficial effects for both investors and market-place providers. Every new exchange that joins the STIC can immediately begin offering access to a large range of active markets with many investors who are currently using other exchanges to do their trading. This provides a great benefit to new entries, and keeps the landscape of crypto-capital exchanges healthy and competetive.

Investors avoid lock-in to a single exchange, and can be assured that the health of any given exchange will not threaten the health of the entire ecosystem. The crypto-capital markets will grow in a decentralized fashion, but the stability of individual investments in virtual tokens is guaranteed by the stability of the entire network, which will become "too big to fail". No individual investor will be left holding a now-worthless token that can no longer be traded, because the niche exchange on which it was created was taken down by a hack, or other unpredictable misfortune.

<a id="behavior-of-forks-relative-to-the-stic"></a>

### Behavior of Forks relative to the STIC

A potential future fork of the Ascension Blockchain, should it occur, can join the STIC network just as any other separate project could. By ensuring the continuity of value exchangeability for traders, and the integratedness of the crypto-capital token markets at large, the choice to remain in the STIC network would benefit any fork.

It is hard to see why users would choose a fork which does not remain in the STIC network. However, the choice between the fork and the original main line remains open, and the STIC network should remain neutral in this regard, and treat the two forks as equal.

<a id="accredited-vs-non-accredited-tokens"></a>

## Accredited vs Non-Accredited Tokens

An accredited token is a token that is semantically tied to an underlying, and an official representative of that underlying entity issued the token, in such a way that the unique mapping between tokens and underlyings is preserved.

Issuing an accredited token has the benefit of the endorsement of the token by the underlying, thereby increasing the scarcity value of the token issued. This creates a situation where a user may choose to issue an accredited token tied to them, or to an entity that they represent, on only one of several competing and non-cooperating market-places. Even if we accept that the STIC, or an equivalent compact, represents the most promising future for the entire crypto-capital ecosystem, we can anticipate the potential for newcomers to challenge the entire industry, by locking in accredited tokens that can only be traded on their exchange, by requiring such a guarantee from the issuers.

This challenge can easily be overcome however by adding an explicit focus on what we will refer to as "token upgrades". A token upgrade is the transition from a non-accredited token to an accredited token by acquiring just such a guarantee and endorsement from representatives of the underlying entities.

This challenge will require a large, decentralized and *strongly incentivized* group effort to accomplish. Acquiring a guaranteed long-term endorsement of a specific crypto-graphic token locks that token into the market-place or, better, the network of market-places which secures it. This guarantees the long-term scarcity prospects of the token investment.

Because of the obvious network, marketing, and growth benefits this bestowes on the network, token-markets based in Ascension and the STIC will reward both the referers, and the issuer themselves for the *initial and continued endorsement*.

This reward is not a single one-time reward. To see why, we must again consider what happens if a competing exchange were to challenge the entire STIC network: The competing exchange could offer larger one-time rewards, which would be paid for by its initial investors. It would then be able to acquire the endorsement of many popular figures, which would increase its immediate scale and visiblity. This undermines the future prospects of the STIC network, by threatening a splintering of the markets into accredited and non-accredited investment trading platforms. It also creates an annoying situation for investors, who now have to trade on multiple exchanges, in order to trade all their favorite underlyings. This added complexity of the ecosystem will put many people off, and thereby reduce the growth potential of the entire crypto-capital markets.

To avoid this, the rewards offered to the issuer are tied to the long-term prospects of the entire ecosystem. The rewards are based on the activity and value of their token, and can be considered similar to stock options.

Because these rewards vest over time, and are continuous, it becomes rational for issuers to choose the network which is likely to garner the most trading interest and activity in the long-term. Issuers themselves now are incentivized to avoid market-splintering, and to only endorse tokens that will be traded within the largest group of crypto-capital exchanges, to maximize their long-term rewards.

As far as non-accredited tokens go, the *virtual scarcity mandate* (discussed in the previous section) guarantees that these tokens too can have scarcity value within the entire STIC network of exchanges, which given the great incentives for joining the network, and the strong disincentives for defecting or refusing to join the network, may some day cover the entire crypto-capital markets. The scarcity value of the non-accredited tokens is thereby not inherently less than a comparable accredited token.

This creates a useful additional incentive for issuers to choose the largest crypto-capital exchange network - an accredited token will not necessarily be able to acquire as large a group of investors than a non-accredited token based on the same underlying process can, if it is traded (uniquely) in a larger, more popular crypto-capital exchange network. In other words, a token market-contained within a small market-place with only 50`000 traders cannot necessarily compete with a comparable non-accredited token that is traded in a network covering millions of investors, *even if the former has the endorsement of a representative of the underlying entity*. This is due to part-time investors general discinclination of having to use many different platforms to do their trading.

This means that the scarcity of the virtual asset is tied to the percentage of market share that the marketplace (or network of marketplaces) has, relative to other marketplaces (or networks of marketplaces) - it is not tied primarily to the issuer.

This vastly expands the possibities as far the nature of virtual assets is concerned. We can freely innovate and begin trading crypto-tokens that are monadically tied to the future prospects of many different underlyings that have up to now not been considered to be tradeable at all in this format.

For example, the prospects of political issues or movements, environmental campaigns (such as the fight against a disease), or existing public or state-owned assets (such as Yosemite Park). The scarcity of these assets will be guaranteed by the virtual scarcity mandate enforced by the crypto-capital market places.

Through the potential of upgrade mechanisms it is then possible that the markets, *after having grown to a significant size* can some day begin offering incentives to outside entities to realize a real-world beneficial effect. This effect can be incentivized through the leverage-capability of the crypto-financial markets.

I will provide two examples:

<a id="example-1-a-movie-director-requests-a-loan-for-an-independent-production"></a>

##### Example 1. A movie director requests a loan for an independent production

A market based on an independent movie director is started, and their token begins to trade - slowly at first, but gaining steam over years alongside their career. As their films become box office successes, the value of their token continues to increase. At some point, the director turns to the up-to-now non-accredited market for funding for a new independent project. The market can now vote to issue a loan to the director, in exchange for which the director will re-invest in the token at a later point. While this contract is not enforceable, the market participants are assured of the honesty of the director, and vote to issue the loan.

The funds for the load come in the form of newly minted currency, which means that the market essentially takes out a loan of its own from the market-place network as a whole - acting as a kind of central bank substitute.

It is in the vital interest of the STIC network as a whole to guarantee that such loans are not issued lightly. However, any market of significant size can be relied upon, as it provides collateral in the form of its own token supply. Investors would lose their tokens, if the loan - which they pass along - went sour, allowing the decentralized network of market-places to rationally and algorithmically determine that the loan is sound.

After the film's release the market begins receiving partial payments from the distribution profits of the film. As the director is keeping their word, the value of their token again increases - enabling them to take out more loans of a similar nature in the future.

The publicity of the funding campaign also further increases the attention on the crypto-capital market places, which increases its mind-share and drives more investment into the eco-system.


The users of an open source software project invest in a token based on that project's success.

# Asset Classes

The possibilities for future crypto-assets under the meta-stability model is near endless. It is limited only by the interests and value judgements of investors.

The number of investors in the crypto-currency markets is still relatively small, but it is growing every day. According to some estimates as much as 155 million U.S. citizens do some form of online trading these days. The global number is far larger.

Growth in individually-accessible investment products in China for example has grown remarkably over the last years. By now, China is the undisputed leader in mobile commerce (sometimes called m-commerce) and mobile finance. 

> In 2016, Chinese consumers spent approximately $22.8 trillion (RMB 157.55 trillion) through mobile payment platforms, far exceeding the volume of transactions in the United States ($112 billion).
> -- [Brookings, 2018](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/02/08/whats-happening-with-chinas-fintech-industry/)

In this environment newcomers like Alibaba and Tencent have been able to successfully challenge the established banking system.

As more and more people use mobile payments, so too the amount of investment that is flowing from consumers directly into novel fintech products has increased dramatically. This burgeoning demand by consumers to participate directly in the financial markets will only increase over the next 10 years, and crypto-finance will be one of the major targets of their investment.

As this is a global trend, wherever the regulatory environment is most helpful to startups pursuing the research and development of novel crypto-financial products there lies the greatest growth potential for the crypto-capital markets.

The combination of mobile finance and crypto-assets will pave the way towards a future in which trading in crypto tokens is an everyday activity, similar to online commenting and text messaging.

The potential for gamification of this activity far exceeds that of traditional financial products - even if gamification had been as much of a design trend in the past as it is today.

Ascension seeks to lay the groundwork for the future exploration of this broad and diverse market segment, taking a step towards the greater democractization of the financial markets - removing the barriers, allowing all to access them freely, and allowing money and value to pour in from all sources.

In the following sections we explore a sampling of the potential targets for investment that the future crypto-capital markets will offer to netizens. **The only thing that will decide how high these types of investments *should* be valued is the market itself.**

<a id="persons"></a>

## Persons

The class of personal virtual assets is as large and varied as human nature. From entrepreneurs to entertainers, from politicians to activists, and from models to movie stars - the range of dynamic time series of data about the past, present and future life of societies' most valued members provides us with a rich trove of real value on top of which scarcity-based investments with stock-like behavior can be constructed.

I certainly will be first in line to invest in the future of the artists, entertainers and entrepreneurs whose music, movies and innovations I have enjoyed, and who I know many others after me will value and appreciate as they continue to create aesthetic and economic value for society.

These persons represent value propositions that I know are sound, and I can judge the markets reactions by the combination of my belief in the bright future of the crypto-capital markets, and the continued life and work of these popular icons. Knowing that other investors that follow after me will value them the same way or more than I do today, I can predict that their market value, while going through the usual ups and downs, will continue to rise, and along with it will the value of my investment.

<a id="projects"></a>

## Projects

Project-based investments are centered around accomplishable goals. If the project makes measurable progress towards those goals, the market can value its chances of success.

This is the class of assets in which the question of whether a token should be accredited in order to trade is a most intersting one, as one of the primary utility of project-based token-offerings is to raise funds for the success of the project itself.

Projects which are funded are clearly advantaged, and as it is in the interest of investors to advantage projects whose success their own profits depend on, they are incentivized to participate in ICOs and other funding rounds. However, usually the funding of the project is only part of the early stage of the market's lifetime. While it is possible for companies to raise money on the stock markets by issuing additional shares, this only happens very infrequently.

Nevertheless, if the market agrees, companies are able to raise additional funds from their stock market investors. This points the way to a re-conceptualisation of market-based financing, away from the one-time IPO-style payout, towards a more continuous, goal-based funding model that is based on the continued demonstration of a projects's ability to meet its targets.

The advantages of this funding model to investors are obvious: they gain more control over the direction that the management takes with the project, and they are better able to both incentivize good performance, and avoid investing more than needed to achieve the greatest possible growth trajectory for the project.

But also entrepreneurs can benefit from this funding model: it should be much easier to get seed funding for explorative work, with the immediate potential of capitalizing on early success to quickly raise more money as expenditures grow; furthermore, projects would be able to freely try to raise money from the markets for expansions, which enables them to grow more quickly in an ever-changing commercial landscape.

The range of different projects that can be the basis for a virtual token asset is very broad. Not only commercial, but also non-commercial projects qualify as the subject of algorithmically-priced trading.

# Goal-Directed Markets: Competetive Leveraged Crowd-Funding using APMs

A goal-directed market (hf. GDM) is an incentivized competition, **open to all comers**, to achieve a certain goal by whatever means they're creativity allows them to conceive.

... (todo: connect to below)

One of the great things that TBCs enable us to do is to use investors as market trend predictors. In this case we are not talking about the token markets themselves, but the markets at large.

If a new product niche is opening up, and will soon become popular, crypto-investors may be able to quickly predict this and form a new token market around the future success of that product niche.

But rather than only tracking the performance of independent projects and companies, a new type of market, which we will call a goal-directed market (**GDM**) can be formed using a set of APMs as its technical basis.

This token market can be used to incentivize and direct the efforts of several *competing project teams*. These project teams may be stood up by existing companies, or formed especially for the purpose of *participating in the GDM competion*.

The goal of each competition is defined by its creators. After that the token-holders and/or their delegates (see below) are tasked with verifying that a specific team has accomplished a specific goal, or reached a specific milestone on a preset roadmap.

If the goal is far out or vague, different milestones towards it may be supported by the market participants via continuous approval voting (see below).

In order to be able to effectively guide and/or support the progress of the individual project teams, they are rewarded after reaching a milestone, and also initially provided with sufficient funding to begin work.

The Ascension network itself will be developed and expanded through just such a GDM. In this case, as in the case of other long-running projects, the roadmap may acquire new milestones over time through a proposal mechanism.

<a id="market-actors-in-gdms"></a>

## Market Actors in GDMs

Besides investors, there are several market actors that are essential to the success of a goal-directed market.

<a id="entrepreneurs"></a>

### Entrepreneurs

First among these are the entrepeneurs. These are individuals and small teams, which form independently, and present applications for funding, and proposals for research and business development to the market.

The market approves or denies the proposals, and judges the progress that the entrepreneurs make on fulfilling their promises.

If entrepreneurs are successful, they end up with funding, a built-in fanbase, and a successful project. The market can continue to trade the token which is guaranteed not to be traded outside of the STIC network. 

It is also possible for entrepreneurs to channel funds back into the market, e.g. through buy-and-burn schemes, following an agreement made prior to funding. In this way it may be possible for entrepeneurs to fairly reward market investors, and go on to issue a token of their own in the independent crypto-financial markets - or stock in the traditional stock markets. The reduction in value due to the reduced scarcity of the STIC token could then be weighed up by the one-time dividend-like payout.

<a id="delegates"></a>

### Delegates

Another type of market participants are the so-called *delegates*, whose function is to **procure and process information**, and present it to investors, so that the market can effectively react to the changing prospects of the underlying investments.

Because, in the case of goal-directed markets, investors are often dealing with small companies and teams who have no other reporting requirements, it is not reasonable for the market to depend on broadly circulated news. To avoid investors having to duplicate their research effort - let alone avoiding the effort altogether and increasing the risk profile of their investments - market-endorsed delegates are incentivized by the blockchain to explicitly gather and collate information about the underlying, and to do so in a neutral and time-sensitive manner.

Each market of a sufficient size, which probably applies to most GDMs, will have multiple independent delegates, whose job it is to keep in direct contact with the project teams, to study their output and progress, and to regularly report their findings and opinions on the future prospects of the underlying to the other investors. In other words, delegates have a similar function to stock analysts in the traditional financial markets.

Delegates can present action recommendations to the market. These recommendations, if followed, can alter the future funding prospects of individual project teams, either by increasing or decreasing their allotments.

Delegates must advance their candidacy, and are approved via continuous approval voting. They can serve as delegates in multiple markets simultaneously.

They are rewarded for their efforts with a share in the profits of the entire GDM, plus a fixed minimum income, which incentivizes their continued time-commitment to the market, and keeps them responsible.

<a id="technical-implementation"></a>

## Technical Implementation

A GDM is implemented using custom blockchain logic to coordinate multiple APMs.

For example at every stage in a roadmap (see below) multiple APMs may exist,
one for each project team, one for the next major milestone, and one for the market as a whole.

The GDM has a single internal token, but so does each separate APM. It is therefore possible to invest either in the GDM as a whole, or in an individual project team's efforts - or both.

<a id="roadmaps"></a>

## Roadmaps

Every GDM follows a roadmap. This roadmap does not need to be worked out completely ahead of time, but it should include at least a few notable milestones, and possibly an endgoal.

Every milestone is associated with rewards. The rewards are distributed after the market participants or their delegates have verified a project team's assertions that the team has met a specific milestone.

New milestones can be created, and some of these can be *optional milestones*. These kinds of milestones are useful to incentivize the development of small features, that are not necessary but could be nice to have.

The time periods between major milestones are called *stages*. Leverage (see below) is applicable only at the end of a stage, i.e. with the accomplishment of a major milestone.

Milestones should be defined in terms of specific metrics whenever possible, to ensure that if any disagreement arises over whether a milestone has been met, an arbitration (see below) can proceed without difficulty to resolve the matter.

Large GDMs may have multiple stages running in parallel. For example the main GDM of the Ascension network will have multiple independent milestones open from the start, allowing third party developers to claim early incentivizes for expanding the infrastructure of the blockchain ecosystem.

<a id="leverage"></a>

## Leverage

GDMs are leveraged via the blockchain. The entire economy stands as guarantor for the credit supplied to the market. As a result the amount of total GDMs active at any given time is limited.

The amount of leverage that can be applied depends on the amount of investment in a market, relative to the amount invested in other GDMs.

Leverage commonly ranges between 2x and 20x.

The theory of operation that supports blockchain-issued leveraging of GDMs is that the investment in a GDM is only re-claimable if the market succeeds. Hence, the investment collected in a GDM fulfills a signalling function that can be interpreted by the blockchain logic.

If many users are willing to stake their money on the success of a given project, relative to other potential projects that are available for investment, this can be used as a predictor of the future success of the GDM.

If the internal markets work efficiently, the entire economy should be *meta-stable* and grow over time. As a result, external investment in the Ascension economy will remain rational, even as more value is created and assigned to fund new projects - the same way that it remains rational to invest in a large sprawling company that has many different profit and cost centers, but continues to grow its consumer-base and revenue at a high rate.

<a id="aggregate-gdms"></a>

## Aggregate GDMs

An aggregate GDM (hf. A-GDM) is an extension of the GDM model which consists of multiple interconnected GDMs whose internal tokens trade *against one another*.

In the A-GDM model, there is one GDM for each part of a puzzle. The puzzle itself may represent different dimensions of interest, e.g. geographical location, or a domain of interest.

As a result, A-GDMs allow us to model organizational divisions that are similar to departments and groups within large international companies. A-GDMs are therefore an integral part of what will enable the Ascension blockchain to function as a true transnational *open company*, with similar effectiveness as traditional centralized organizations.

<a id="example-the-international-growth-a-gdm-of-ascension-itself"></a>

#### Example: The International Growth A-GDM of Ascension itself

Ascension itself uses the A-GDM model in order to govern itself. In the built-in "International Growth" A-GDM, one GDM for each international region and sub-region exists, each with its own token. The regional GDMs are used to assign budgets to growth initiatives proposed by users, senators, and entrepreneurs. These budgets are approved by the individual GDM market participants. However, the size of the budget that can be distributed by any specific regional GDM is limited by the relative performance of the GDM's token compared to the other regional GDMs.

This relative performance is measured by the A-GDM, which manages the entire "International Growth" budget of the network.

<a id="recursive-a-gdms"></a>

### Recursive A-GDMs

The A-GDM model is obviously recursive, such that different A-GDMs can also be traded against one another. In this way, the "International Growth" A-GDM mentioned above can be traded off against the "Technical Development" A-GDM which governs the software development effort of the Ascension eco-system's main components.

Through this recursive property, the entire budget of the blockchain is under the control of the internal market.

<a id="overlap-between-a-gdms"></a>

### Overlap between A-GDMs

A single GDM's internal token can be trade relatively to other GDMs within multiple independent A-GDMs. This allows a single goal-directed market to participate in multiple budget competitions simultaneously.

While this kind of overlap is not usually needed, it sometimes makes sense, when a GDM has a split focus.

<a id="promotion-of-gdms-to-a-gdms"></a>

### Promotion of GDMs to A-GDMs

Any GDM which grows too large may be promoted to an A-GDM. This allows the internal initatives, which previously required the attention of all market participants to acquire a vote quorum, to proceed independently, with only the oversight of the market participants who care about that particular goal.

E.g. a regional-growth focused GDM which grows too large can be split up into an A-GDM which oversees several independent national GDMs.

The process through which a GDM is split into an A-GDM is specified in the GDM contract code, and the split-vote requires a simple majority of (active) stake in the GDM in order to pass.

<a id="growing-the-system-to-amazon-scale"></a>

#  Growing the System to "Amazon" scale

The fully decentralized and internally-competetive Ascension ecosystem is designed to function similar to an **Open Company**, i.e. a company that has no borders, and whose internal projects anyone who feels capable and interested enough can participate in at any time - receiving funds to do their part, and profiting from the success of the project and the "company" as a whole.

In the open company model, **entrepreneurs and freelancers** take the place of the traditional managers and employees. The direction of the company, as well as which projects are pursued and to which extent, is decided directly by the **decentralized consensus of the stake-holders**, acting directly or through their chosen delegates.

<a id="background"></a>

### Background

Even though decentralized models of economic organization have been tried out and refined many times over the last years throughout the crypto-economy, we have still not seen a *clear winning formula* emerge that promises to revolutionize *not just* the organizational aspect of the equation, but also **increase commercial project success and profits**.

We believe this is not a failure of the model itself, but only the *growing pains* of a new paradigm, as the early implementations continue to be revised and improved - and **new organizational structures continue to emerge**. The potential inherent in the access to a much wider talent pool, combined with the prescience of prediction markets, provides a significant possible advantage over more traditional structures - but it requires just the right framework for these advantages to become fully exploitable.

<a id="the-ascension-model"></a>

### The Ascension Model

The development of the Ascension blockchain code, as well as any extensions that the market may demand is driven through a set of GDMs that vie for rewards in a regularly repeating algorithmically-assessed competition.

This mirrors the way that the (mostly-independent) departments of a company compete to produce the most value in any given quarter, in order to have their funding increased by the company at large.

In the case of Ascension, the "*company at large*"" is the market itself, made up of **all stake-holders**.

    TODO: expand this section to describe the model in more detail

<a id="the-great-puzzle-of-decentralization"></a>

## The Great Puzzle of Decentralization

GDMs and A-GDMs allow us to sub-divide the eco-system by economic areas of interest.

Individual GDMs and aggregates that focus on specific *technological domains, business models, or organizational tasks* are interconnected through the blockchain, and its single common token, the Cubit (CU).

Each GDM remains internally competetive, relying on GDM-participants to predict the value of the most promising projects, route *funds* to those projects, ensure their *transparency* and oversee their *progress*.

Because the GDMs usually do not overlap in their areas of interest, the entire collection of GDMs fits together like the pieces of a large puzzle. That puzzle is the open company.

**For example**, a GDM focussed on Ascension's market penetration into East Asia would likely be mostly made up of investors with greater insight into the unique characteristics of that region and its specific growth potential. They would be able to select among approaches that are more or less likely to achieve a product-market fit, and aggressively pursue those goals which will create the most value within the East Asia GDM - benefitting the entire blockchain as a direct result of their self-interested action.

They would therefore be able to judge which delegates can best serve the interests of the entire eco-system in this regard.

The open company is thereby sharded into many different departments and sub-departments that cover our shared interests across the entire globe.

Because blockchain participants hail from all over the world, it does not make sense to limit the focus of our expansion by the limited attention span of a centralized management group, such as e.g. that of the core developers.

We believe that the puzzle analogy presents us with a more realisting picture of truly decentralized co-ordinated cooperation, strongly increasing the likelihood of achieving this still ephemeral vision, which most extant blockchains have struggled to realize in practice.

It is using *this* model that Ascension hopes to become the first *truly decentralized autonomous corporation*. A blockchain which is always open to new entrants - **without socio-economic barriers creeping in to limit the meritocratic *intent* of the design**.

<a id="funding-entrepreneurs"></a>

## Funding Entrepreneurs

Over the last two years, the amount of entrepreneurship in the crypto-financial ecosystem has multiplied more than tenfold. Entrepreneurs are streaming into the space to work on token-based projects, because they see it as a great new way to acquire funding for their innovative ideas, and they see an exciting space that is poised for explosive growth over the first half of the coming decade.

Forward-thinking VCs have taken note of this and are more and more trying to work with the crypto-financial ecosystem in order to profit by selling their stake to longer-term investors in an IPO-equivalent fashion - only much earlier in the project development cycle. ICOs have been the lure, but as the potential of crypto-economic systems continues to expand, it will more and more become a channel for traditional capital funds to acquire stakes in exciting new investments, perhaps the next Twitter or Airbnb.

From the perspective of the Ascension stake-holders, the question arises how best to profit from this newly emerging phenomenon of **decentralized VC funding**. We can distinguish two ways in which to benfit from this trend:

1. by channelling such investment through the platform, and 
 
2. by investing directly in new projects or entrepreneurs with ideas at an early stage in the project development cycle.

In this section I want to focus on the second scenario, in which Ascension itself acts as a kind of VC fund, and in which funds are channeled into projects which either do or do not come with dividend flows, and which either do or do not promise ownership stakes held by the decentralized autonomous blockchain.

The goal here, which many Dapp ecosystems seem to have somewhat missed, is not to incentivize a host of small projects which drain the funds of the investors, but to select and pick among the most promising startup teams to support, and then help and encourage them to succeed with their vision to create a new high-growth startup or "killer app". The returns on venture capital investments usually stem from a small subset of projects. A common formula that is often cited is that out of 10 projects, 8 will lose money, 1 will break even, and 1 will generate the profits to cover all the other failed investments (and then some). Therefore to be successful it suffices to sufficiently bias ones' selection process to include at least some wildy-successful projects.

But the number of these projects is severly limited, as all the markets they might target are competetive. For this reason, there is generally more money available than there are outstanding entrepreneurs to convert this money into profitable enterprises. There exists, in other words, a competetion for the best entrepreneurs, and in order for decentralized and blockchain-based venture capital to become a successful industry, it must try to win in this competetion, at least some of the time.

The major advantage that blockchain-based funding provides over the traditional VC industry is the easy access to funds that the global and decentralized nature of the crypto-ecosystem presents. The most important goal of a decentralized funding model should therefore be to leverage this strength, for example by making it as easy as possible for newcomers from all over the globe to get access to early-stage funding, and growth funding, while still disincentivizing and preventing scammers from abusing the system to profit without providing any substantial value in return.

The target, in other words, must be to create a **relaxed funding environment** compared to the traditional VC industry, and more akin to popular crowdfunding models like Kickstarter and Patreon. ICOs are already very popular among founders.


However the ICO model has taken a significant reputational loss over the last year (2018). A lot of projects fail unnecessarily, and there is a significant amount of fraud and scams, that leave investors with avoidable losses.

The current lack of transparency in project financials, largely due to the lump sump payments which represent a leap of faith from investors that too often leads them into trusting scammers, has weakened trust in the ICO pattern in general. To further relax the model presents a scary prospect.

While the ICO model has quickly gained popularity, it has clearly also been an open target for dishonest scammers who simply intended from the start to defraud investors and take off with the money. It has therefore been proposed that a switch from lump-sum payouts to incremental funding could help to reduce the potential for exploitation

To reduce both fraud, and the probability of the failure of any given investment, we support this idea of moving towards an incremental funding model. The prior and posterior probabilities of fraud in continuous milestone-based payout schemes vs lump-sum ICOs are far reduced: the probability of scammers actually going through the difficult process of making continuous verifieable progress towards the market's stated goal is very low.
        
If entrepreneurs and project teams really are putting in the work and producing continuous (incremental) results, they are far less likely to be the kind of people who would break their reciprocal (public) commitments to the blockchain community, and incur the permanent reputational damage of having done so.

To restore this trust, we move to an incremental funding model with funds dispersed only as long as continuous verifieable progress is made by the project team.

## Hiring Freelancers and Contractors

...

Many blockchains have tried to expand in many different directions, but overall their expansion is hampered by one or more of several easy-to-spot factors:

    TODO: expand on how Ascension approaches these challenges

<a id="2-the-individual-projects-that-are-rewarded-are-not-pre-selected-for-their-market-potential"></a>

### 2. The individual projects that are rewarded are not pre-selected for their market potential

Every blockchain cannot create a Google Docs competitor that can expect to attract any amount of users. This kind of engineering work requires planning, funding, and dedication.

Most *nested* Dapp projects extant today that are not aimed specifically at the internal crypto-financial markets, do not rise above the demo level.

The Ascension ecosystem functions more similar to Kickstarter: projects are proposed, and are funded only if they attract a certain amount of support. This guarantees that projects that receive funds appeal to at least a significant segment of the target market.

<a id="3-there-is-no-drive-for-success-culture-built-into-the-design-of-the-internal-blockchain-ecosystem"></a>

### 3. There is no drive-for-success culture built into the design of the *internal* blockchain ecosystem

Many blockchain projects extant today were structured around an ICO. This means that once the team has been paid the urgency of the need to compete with other blockchain projects that the team *feels* is substantially decreased.

As far as projects go that build on top of blockchains, or are incentivized to be built by blockchains, usually the need for success that individual project developers feel is limited by the potential benefit they can hope to achieve for themselves.

The slower and less driven the ecosystem feels, the more languishing and slow approaches and lack of success are visible, the less dedicated the individual entrepreneurs will become.

It is a vicious cycle that leads to the ecosystem as a whole losing out to other ecosystems, or to traditional companies, with better incentive structures.

    TODO

<a id="currency-model-and-algorithmic-financial-policy"></a>

# Currency Model and Algorithmic Financial Policy

The currency of Ascension is called the Cubit (CU). It is sub-divided into quarks and preons, such that 1000 quarks make one cubit, and 1000 preons (the smallest number of currency in the system) make one quark.

The currency as a whole is subject to *algorithimically controlled inflation*, which is guided by the external valuation of a the CU token. The goal of the financial policy is to *maintain strong inflation* of the currency supply, while keeping the value of a single cubit close to the value of a single U.S. dollar. 

A cubit is not a stablecoin. The variation in the price of a Cubit should range from approximately $0.20 on the low end, to $2-3 dollars on the high end. It is up to the smart contract governing the inflation, as well as the Ascension Senate Financial Policy Committee to ensure that the value of the coin does not stray too far away from the $1 target - while the amount of Cubits in circulation keeps increasing at a **large but varying rate**.

As new cubits are minted, they are distributed through the A-GDM mechanism, whose primary focus is to distribute leverage among the active token markets. This means that traders who have invested in internal markets will see their Cubit-denominated profits increased through the inflation, as the leverage allows successful markets to appreciate in price and market-cap faster than they otherwise would.

To ensure that noone who purchases cubits is disadvantaged simply because they do not trade in the internal markets, by default any holder of a CU token is also invested in the *Ascension Standard Market* fund. The assets stored in the **ASM** are controlled by algorithmically chosen *top-traders*, who consistently invest smartly in the internal Ascension markets, and who benefit through small management fees from the profits they make for the fund.

The ASM fund's Cubit-denominated profits are distributed automatically among all participating stake-holders - which includes anyone who purchases Cubits on an exchage, and maintains their balance in the exchange's wallet. Through the *Standard Inflation* of the account balances, which is based on the success of the competetively and decentrally administered ASM fund, the constant inflation of the currency benefits all cubit HODLers automatically.

This design has several interesting properties.

1. The Cubit is *useable as a currency* - similar to the Euro or the Yen, which stay within a certain proportional range to the U.S. dollar - even though it is not a stable-coin. It can serve both as a unit of exchange, and as a store of value.

2. The variance in the price through the fluctuation of the slowly adjusted financial policy, as well as through the near-term project and market successes of the internal blockchain ecosystem, supports speculation on exchanges. This speculation in turn will provide for *longterm liquidity* on the global crypto-exchanges.

3. Investment in the Cubit as a *strongly appreciating stock* remains as easy, as using it to invest in specific STIC-internal tokens. Because Cubit holdings increase over time, there is no need for a price-increase on the exchanges in order for Cubit-investors to profit - all that is needed is that the price remains mostly stable.

<a id="competetive-decentralized-management"></a>

# Competetive Decentralized Management

Ascension is governed by stake-holders via *efficient* delegated proof-of-stake voting.

Here we propose a unique combination of several mechanisms to ensure unprecendented effectiveness in decentralized governance. With these mechanisms in place, the system should be able to govern itself, expand to arbitrary size, and react quickly to any changes in the technological, legal and economic context.

<a id="1-mechanism-efficient-majority-consensus"></a>

## 1. Mechanism: Efficient Majority Consensus

Many situations call for a decision that should be representative of the interests of the majority of stake-holders, and/or the majority of stake-holders with a particular field of interest (e.g. an internal market).

To guarantee the efficiency of this type of voting, the blockchain enforces the following simple but powerful rule:

> **non-vote-participation => non-vote-eligibility**

By this rule, in order for a non-vote to be counted as an abstention, a user must have been recently active in the community, and/or voted on another subject in the same round of voting.

The implementation works as follows: for all blockchain-governance purposes, a user's stake is auto-delegated with respect to a given vote, iff

1. the user has NOT been recently active, AND
2. the user has NOT delegated their stake to another user.
        
Users which have explicitly delegated their stake to another user are not eligible for auto-delegation. 

(Note however that if a user A delegates their stake to another user B, and B delegates their stake to C, both A and B may become inactive. But if C becomes inactive as well, none of the stake of A and B
will be considered as part of the voting process, unless A or B choose to vote for themselves, or to re-delegate their stake to another party.

To deal with this eventuality, it is possible to define fall-back delegates,
which take over a user's voting stake if and only if (and only for that period of time) that the user's primary delegate become inactive.)

Auto-delegated stake is essentially not considered in governance decisions, allowing decisions to reach a sufficient majority even when voter turnout is low, as is commonly observed in many crypto-economic systems.

Low voter turnout negatively interferes with the efficiency of crypto-economic governance systems based on either minimum-quorum or minimum-majority rule sets.

Many decisions that are proposed that would positively affect the value of the blockchain ecosystem, such as expansions, or that would avert even very strong and immediate losses, such as reacting to a security flaw, are not able to acquire a sufficient quorum or majority within a relevant time frame, sometimes with catastrophic consequences.

The clearest example of this is probably the failure of [TheDAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)),
during which the consensus mechanisms in place completely failed to achieve any kind of immediate or even useful consensus action that would counter the hacker that was draining its funds.

Instead of abandoning these rule sets completely, Ascension relies on the auto-delegation mechanism to keep the *actively concerned* stake-holders in control, while allowing passive investors to benefit from the greater effectiveness and safety of *timely and pro-active decentralized consensus*.

<a id="2-mechanism-continuous-approval-voting"></a>

## 2. Mechanism: Continuous-Approval Voting

While the first mechanism ensures that majority-relevant decisions are made in an effective time frame, the second mechanism is meant to enable the blockchain to represent minority positions more effectively.

Continuous approval voting works through the ability of users to stake tokens in favor of one or another side of a continuous, long-running (possibly multi-choice) vote.

E.g. the vote for the set of senators is a constantly-open vote, in which the possible choices (i.e. senate-candidates) regularly change. Users can stake some or all of their tokens in favor of one or several different candidates, without those tokens being encumbered in any other way, than that they cannot be counted twice within the specific vote context.

After an initial grace period, or minimum-stake threshold has been met, the result of a continuous vote can be accessed at every future point through the web interface. The result may also be queried by other smart contracts, such as the standard contract which manages the senate seats (including the multi-signature key distribution). This particular contract queries the vote result once every quarter, which translates to a minimum time-in-office for senators of 3 months.

**Detailed Example:** a user who supports Joe and Mary as candidates for office, and who owns 1000 CUBITS, can stake 400 for Joe and 500 for Mary. If they spend 100 CUBITS and now only have 900 left, the value of their votes will be unaffected. If they spend another 90 CUBITS, and have 810 CUBITS left, the value of their votes will be reduced proportionally: 360 CUBIT-equivalents for Joe, and 450 CUBIT-equivalents for Mary. If the user ever regains a full 900 tokens, the vote-values of their continuously staked tokens will be increased again, to the pre-specified limit.

Users can unstake their tokens at any time, removing support for a candidate or for any other possible vote-outcome. It is also possible to stake all of one's tokens for a specific outcome, or to commit to a certain proportional stake-distribution. This works the same as in the example above, but if the user suddenly has 9000 tokens, then the value of their votes will automatically be adjusted to 4000 for Joe, and 5000 for Mary.

Adjustments to vote-equivalents are made at timed intervals, to avoid constant costly recomputations due to changing account balances. The exact time intervals are not fixed, but will be less than or equal to 24 hours.

Finally, as a possible safety mechanism to hedge against lost private keys, it may be necessary *for users with a significant amount of staked tokens relative to any given vote context* to regulary re-affirm their continuously staked token votes. This may happen at intervals of somewhere between one quarter, and one year. If this mechanism is added to the blockchain, it may be disabled on-request by users who do not feel the need to be repeatedly bothered by having to re-affirm their votes, and who do not feel it is likely they will lose their private keys and/or passwords.

<a id="example-voting-for-senators"></a>

#### Example: Voting for Senators

A good example of the utility of continuous approval voting is the election of the senators (who, among other things, elect and supervise the block producers of the delegated-proof-of-stake blockchain on top of which the Ascension network is based).

Because the senators are responsible for an important part of both the financial security and the blockchain governance (as will be explained below), they should represent a broad spectrum of interests. In order to accomplish this, Ascension supports a market-based continuous-approval voting scheme, wherein senator-candidate tokens are traded using an A-GDM, and those candidates with the highest current market value at specific intervals, will be tasked to run the blockchain nodes for the next quarter.

If a senator falls below the current minimum support level, they are disqualified from running their node during the next quarter.

Senator candidates can run on a platform, promising to stand for certain values. The continuous-approval approach to elections guarantees that there is high turnover among senators who no longer seem to represent the future interests of their constituents, i.e. who do not live up to the promises they made.

<a id="the-ascension-senate"></a>

## The Ascension Senate

*Senators* are the most important elected participants in the blockchain ecosystem. They are ultimately responsible for guaranteeing that the blockchain runs at all, and that it remains secure.

They do not themselves run the blockchain, but they do determine who does: they elect and supervise the block producers.

The election of senators is described above. Once elected, their blockchain account will be automatically added to the appropriate blockchain consensus group once the next quarter begins.

Unlike other blockchains, Ascension is at its heart a social network, and senators are users who are expected to participate widely in the social discourse which governs the direction that the network will take. You should be able to talk to the senators freely if you have any concern about the future of the network.

In accordance with this social vision of the blockchain, the number of senators is specified to grow quite large. By the time the main net launches, up to 100 senators may take office - but by the end of the first year of Ascension's main net, the number of senate seats should be grown to approximately 600.

The size of the senate, and the specific way that senate seats are gerrymandered (by both geographic location, and focus of interest) guarantees the decentralized nature of the Ascension Senate, and thereby also that of the entire blockchain. Senate seats will be held by people from all over the world, and will be split up among people with different backgrounds and interests; this guarantees that technical aptitude, business acumen, and decentralized idealism will all be proportionally represented in the Senate at all times. (For more details see docs/Senate.md in the github repo.)

Anyone who wants to become a senator for Ascension should be ready to shoulder the responsibility of protecting the network, protecting the interests of its users, and helping to grow the network as large as it can be.

Senators not only have technical but also other important duties. One of the things they are responsible for is last-instance arbitration between parties (see below). Another is the setting of the financial policy parameters for the next following quarter (see above).

Senators are rewarded for their service to the community of stake-holders, which serves to support and incentivize their substantial time-commitment to the blockchain. The rewards are designed to be enough to ensure that senators do not *need* a separate day-job, which could otherwise divide their attention away from ensuring the future prospects of the network.

<a id="global-focus"></a>

### Global Focus

The selection of senators must be representative of the global nature of the Ascension business model.

Even though the user base may be initially biased in their demographics, the senators should always represent the larger global market as a whole. The purpose of this is to preserve the *future outlook* of the Ascension ecosystem as a transnational enterprise.

The transnational focus opens up a much larger *total addressable market* than a more regionally-biased approach, while tending to insulate the success of the business from *temporarily*-adverse regulatory environments on the national level.

If the representation of senators were to be biased early on in the direction of one nation or another, this might bias decisions about the financial policy in favor of a less international approach.

This is contrary to the design principles of the open company ecosystem, and would hamper the growth prospects of the entire blockchain.

Participation in the economy must always be possible independent of national origin, and the focus on expansion should not be limited by the *lack of familiarity* with specific local or regional characteristics of the various global markets.

The transnational market is far larger than any national or regional market on its own.

Whether it be in China, Japan, the Phillipines, the U.S. or Brazil, there are too many growth opportunities that would be missed if the representation of senators was skewed too much in one direction or another. An early focus on the expansion into different markets is achieved through the Aggregate GDM mechanism, which distributes the larger budget over a range of regional GDMs. 

The GDM and A-GDM mechanisms hold individual growth initiatives to account for their success and growth deadlines: faster initiatives will receive more funding in the next budget cycle, and this will allow the Ascension ecosystem to grow fastest in those international markets in which the Ascension business model can most quickly *penetrate*, and achieve high growth rates.

For all of these reasons we require senators to authenticate their identity, and their place of residence, through a decentralized mechanism.

Maximum quotas are then applied to senate seats per global region, allowing for a balanced, though still market-driven representation of the interests of all present and future Ascension stake-holders.

### Election

(see section on governance, above)

<a id="oversight-and-impeachment"></a>

### Oversight and Impeachment

Senators who vote too infrequently, or are too inactive will have their rewards reduced, and will probably be voted out by the next quarter.

The voting record of any senator is indexed on the blockchain, and easily accessible via the web interface. This enables users to verify that the senators they support are indeed following through on their "campaign promises".

Should a senator fail to live up to the expectations of their electorate,
and should the process of quarterly turnover prove too inefficient at removing the senator from the consensus set, a sufficient quorum of the electorate of the senator can issue a recall-vote using the majority-consensus mechanism.

This recall-vote will take effect, as soon as the next available candidate can be confirmed by the blockchain to be ready to take the old senators place. This is usally on the order of a few days.

<a id="block-producers"></a>

## Block Producers

*Block Producers* have the important function of running the blockchain consensus algorithms. In the underlying EOS.IO based blockchain architecture, 21 block producers are selected, who are responsible for keeping the network running smoothly, and providing access to the latest state of the blockchain to all. In addition to these, several backup block producers are on stand-by, in case the main block-producers are taken offline by ill-fortune or a co-ordinated attack on the network.

The selection of block producers is determined *indirectly* by stake-holders via the Ascension Senate. Senators are tasked with selecting the block producers from a range of applicants, and offering them a 1-year renewable contract. The block producers can be individuals, or small companies. They should be globally distributed, so as to ensure the resilience of the blockchain to all adversaries.

Block Producers are expected to run state-of-the-art hardware in order to sustain sub-second transaction times for all trading. To enable anyone to participate in this form, a regularly minted reward is paid out by the blockchain consensus to each individual block producer. This reward can be converted to cash and used to pay hosting and administration fees.

If a block producer is seen to not fulfill their service guarantees, their contract can be revoked by the senators before it expires, and assigned to a new applicant. This impeachment action requires a 2/3 majority of senators to pass.

<a id="dispute-resolution-through-decentralized-arbitration"></a>

## Dispute Resolution through Decentralized Arbitration

Usually the algorithmic logic of the blockchain deals with all normal disputes that occur without explicit user intervention. However, it is unavoidable that some cases require additional human effort to resolve.

For this purpose, a slowly-escalating mechanism is proposed, which 

This can occur when e.g. a project-based token investment turns out to be a scam. Token holders may want to rescind rewards previously allocated to token-issuers, and to accomplish this, they begin an arbitration process.

Any whistleblower can initiate arbitration via the blockchain, at the (usually temporary) cost of a small deposit.

If the result of the arbitration indicates that the investment was a scame, the whistleblower will be rewarded beyond their initial deposit.

If the result of the arbitration is that the investment was not a scam, but the arbitration was initiated in good faith, the whistleblower will see their deposit returned.

Otherwise, the deposit of the supposed whistleblower will be burned, to disincentivize misuse of the arbitration mechanism.

<a id="lower-arbitration-disputes-concerning-small-investments"></a>

### Lower Arbitration: Disputes concerning small investments

Arbitration on minor investments is performed via a jury of randomly chosen users, who are incentivized to vote. Jury members receive a minor reward for any vote they cast, and a major reward for any vote cast that matches the majority jury opinion.

The accounts offered a jury participation are pseudo-randomly picked among active users by the blockchain logic, and revolve to ensure a fair distribution of the chance of participating in a jury.

The jury votes are cast in secret, and transmitted to the senators in encrypted form. Only after all votes have been cast, are the jury members revealed, along with the majority decision taken. (If a user does not want their username to be revealed, they cannot participate in the jury mechanism.)

Jury members must do their own research to determine how to vote, and are incentivized to vote rationally, to mirror the majority position of the other jury members.

(It is possible for users to opt out completely from the jury lottery, if a user considers being asked to participate a hassle, e.g. via the account settings menu.)

If either party disagrees with the assessment of the jury, an appeal can be lodged at cost,
moving the dispute further to higher arbitration. The amount required to challenge a jury arbitration
should be a sufficiently large percentage of the disputed amount, to discourage frequent appeals.

The sum may be recovered iff the appeal is successful.

<a id="higher-arbitration-disputes-concerning-large-investments"></a>

### Higher Arbitration: Disputes concerning large investments

Arbitration on larger investments follow a similar process, but instead of a randomly selected jury, the voting is done by (a random subset of) the senators.

The senators are *not additionally incentivized* to vote with the majority, as they need to maintain their voting record to ensure the future support of their electorate.

The decision of the senators is final, and cannot be appealed further.

<a id="consequences-of-arbitration"></a>

### Consequences of Arbitration

If an investment is determined to be a scam through the arbitration process, all future rewards (= leverage) not yet distributed are cancelled, and any time-locked funds are rescinded.

The funds thus re-claimed are divided into exactly 100 pieces, and these pieces are gifted to arbitrary active users via lottery.

This lottery ensures that the dispute process cannot be abused to re-claim large project rewards for the network by users who do not believe in the specific project, and who want to avoid dilution.

Which projects are funded is up to the internal market, and should not be overridable via arbitration.

<a id="content-value-creation-in-the-future-of-social-networks"></a>

# Content-Value Creation in the Future of Social Networks

A significant characteristic of the Ascension blockchain that distinguishes it from most crypto-currency projects is its social focus. Like the venerable Steem blockchain, on which content-creators are rewarded for freely sharing their work with the community, the design of Ascension is based around that of a social network.

But instead of thinking of the Ascension social network as an isolated island that is disconnected from the rest of the social sphere, we believe that the future of the Social Internet lies in the interconnection of the different content economies, and their monetization through the communal act of **appropriately valuing the efforts of content-creators**, who freely share beautiful, entertaining, or informative content with the world.

The model for this idea is based on the concept of the [Interledger Protocol](https://medium.com/xpring/interledger-how-to-interconnect-all-blockchains-and-value-networks-74f432e64543), developed by XRP/Ripple. The *Interledger* is designed as a routing network which transmits value (esp. monetary value) between different end-users, transparently converting from one currency or crypto-currency to another along the way. Value is packetized into little chunks, the same way *data* is routed through the Internet. This enables individual routing providers to maintain a limited amount of currency reserves in many different denominations, and relying on fast settlement to never exhaust their reserves as they provide liquidity to the decentralized payment network.

We propose that an analogy to this idea may someday be realized throughout the entire digital social sphere. A decentralized virtual economy will spring up, which is based on the routing and exchange of **content-value**.

Content-value will function similarily to the scarcity-value of tokens on the Ascension blockchain. However it will not be locked up in one individual social network, but freely tradeable and exchangeable across the Internet.

The lack of break-out success of the first generation of crypto-social projects like Steem can be traced to the absence of network effects, through the insistence on capturing the value inside a single system or token.

This is completely different from how social networks work in reality. They are always faced with a chicken-and-egg problem, which can only be solved by getting users to enjoy the platform. However, the model of first-generation crypto-social blockchains (incl. Steem) assumed that users would flock to the idea of creating content for money to such an extent, that the value of the enjoyment found in social networks could be weighed up.

This does not work in practice, as most people share their content freely first because of the positive emotional value they gain from that activity, and not because of a monetary reward.

However, this does not mean that content does not have value: on the contrary, we believe that all content shared freely that is appreciated by others has content-value, and that this content-value can be captured and transferred into monetary value.

We therefore propose the following setup as part of the future infrastructure of a global routing network of content-value, which allows people to **first and foremost** share their creations freely with their followers on whichever social network they prefer to use. The act of sharing however leaves a digital record, and **this record proves their ownership of the content-value they have created**, both now and in the future.

This content-value can then later be transferred from one social network to another, or from a social network into the larger economy, through crypto-currency.

By disconnecting the act of content-value creation from the act of content-value to monetary-value exchange, this second-generation model of crypto-social value generation side-steps the chicken-and-egg problem that other crypto-social network startups face, by connecting to the existing social networks and their userbase, such as Instagram, Twitter and Youtube.

# Proof-of-Stake Blockchain based on EOS.IO

The Ascension blockchain is based on the EOS.IO blockchain infrastructure software developed by Daniel Larimer and the team and Block.One. It is a fast, semi-centralized design with 21 block producers at the heart of the network.

Behind the 21 block producers are the stand-by block producers, which maintain a readiness to take the place of the active block producers, should those fail for any reason.

Around the block producers are various blockchain infrastructure providers, such as the federated web endpoint servers. These web endpoint servers are especially important in the Ascension eco-system, because it is geared towards non-technical users.

Anyone who is confirmed by the Senate to do so can start running the Ascension server software, connect to the blockchain, and begin offering services to new users.

In order to improve performance of the network, it is likely that block producers will be required to co-locate in specific data-centers, or within specific cities. However the details of this have not been worked out yet, and it is up to the Senate to enforce this co-location.

The reason to co-locate the hardware is that the performance of the EOS.IO software in terms of transaction throughput depends a lot on the network latency between the block producers. While this may not be a problem initially, it should be an early target of the relevant Senate sub-committee to ensure the uninterrupted scalability of the blockchain.

<a id="integrating-the-capabilities-of-other-blockchains-into-ascension"></a>

## Integrating the Capabilities of other Blockchains into Ascension

The EOS.IO Software supports efficient inter-blockchain communication. This capability, is today only seen in the most advanced blockchains, but will in the coming years serve to inter-connect most all the smart-contract supporting crypto-currency networks, including Ethereum.

### Dash

Dash is a payments-oriented blockchain structured as a semi-centralized DAO.

The block reward on Dash is split up into tiers, such that the lowest tier are
the miners, which receive 45%, the next highest are the master-nodes (miners which have the ability to put up 1000 DASH (today ~ $200,000) for the privilege of running such a server), and 10% into a "decentralized benefit budget".

The 10% budget is administered by the DASH core developers, with the direction they choose verified by the consensus of the master node owners. There are approximately 5000 master nodes today.

A problem with this setup is the highly centralized nature of the arrangement, which makes it very similar to a normal company under a unified management structure. While this does not imply anything inherently negative, it does not represent a very attrative role model for a more fully decentralized organization like Ascension.

The DASH "decentralized benefit budget" can be efficiently spent by the "Dash Core Group, Inc.", which comprises and employs the core developers. This has enabled them to implement a number of very user-friendly features, such as web-login-only access to the blockchain.

The immediate future for the Dash blockchain looks bright, as they are meeting their roadmap commitments. However we believe the long-term outlook might be hampered by the centralized management structure.

Master node owners appear to be shepherded by the core management team, and rather than setting the agenda as in a properly decentralized, market-driven arrangement, merely follow along with the direction set by the
official company, depending almost solely on the capability of the Dash Core Group, Inc. of making significant headway into the payments space.
